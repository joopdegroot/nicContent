    <para>Often when we speak about the promotion of chess, we argue that the game should be
        attractive as a spectator sport. And mostly we realize that, as it is, chess is not much of
        a spectator sport. Take the Reykjavik Open, one of the most popular opens on the calendar
        and rightly so. A great country, hospitable people, a marvellous venue, what more do you
        want? Spectators? There are hardly any in the hall, but there are thousands who follow the
        live broadcasts on the Internet. Are their interests looked after? Yes and no. They have a
        bunch of games to choose from and there is live commentary to entertain them. But what
        happened in the last round? What might have been a rousing finale with the two leaders
        meeting head-on, turned out to be a big anti-climax when the game ended in a draw after
        three moves. Here’s the big clash between Pavel Eljanov and Wesley So: 1.d4 ♘f6 2.c4 g6
        3.♘c3 d5 ½-½. A telling detail was that at first no one really seemed to care. The organizer
        said he understood, it was fine with him, and the players even took their time to proudly
        pose for a photograph with the final position between them. And then an emotional discussion
        erupted. Wasn’t it a disgrace that the players showed such contempt for their audience? Or
        was their decision easy to understand? Should the organizers be blamed? Hardly. They might
        have forced them to play 30 or 40 moves, but if the players really wanted a draw they would
        have solved that problem without much effort either. Can we blame the players? Hardly. They
        secured shared first place and Eljanov even knew that whatever happened in the other games,
        he would get the biggest cut of the prize-money. Still it leaves us with an uncomfortable
        feeling and we wonder why that is. It’s easy. Consciously or subconsciously we think of the
        chess players that excite us most. Players like Carlsen, Topalov, Kasparov, Fischer, and
        there are several more. Players who want to win all the time. Who are ready to play 10 games
        if a tournament lasts 10 rounds. Who don’t understand that at the age of 19, Wesley So
        doesn’t even try to win the tournament alone and that instead he is happy to be one of
        several players who split first prize. It’s all about mentality, and as long as this
        mentality doesn’t change, rules to force the players to play will only have limited effect.
        Fortunately, it used to be much worse in times not that distant, when most players felt
        there was nothing wrong with creating some extra free days by making short draws. It’s
        certainly true that today’s chess is much more fighting, thanks to the examples mentioned,
        but we still have a long way to go. With the right mentality each player would try to play
        each round that a tournament lasts. That’s not always possible, there may be days that you
        have a headache, but essentially that should be the ambition. After Eljanov and So had drawn
        their game, six players could catch up with them to share first place. Only one of them
        succeeded: Amin Bassem from Egypt, who beat Grzegorz Gajewski of Poland. Together these
        three divided 8,250 euro according to the Hort system, meaning that Eljanov got most. For
        Eljanov it was a shame that this non-game of the last day will probably be remembered better
        than the great games he played in the rest of the tournament. That’s a pity and he could
        have avoided it. Here’s an example of what he is really capable of.
