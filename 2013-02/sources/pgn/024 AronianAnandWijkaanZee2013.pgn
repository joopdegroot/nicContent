{This game was played in Round 4. So far my tournament had gone very well with
the third round win over .} 1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 e6 5. e3 {
Levon has done a bit of everything against the Meran and every time he makes a
choice at the board you have to think 'Ah, so what do I want against this?'}
Nbd7 6. Bd3 dxc4 7. Bxc4 b5 8. Bd3 Bd6 {By the time we got this far I had the
feeling we might be moving to the line that soon would be on the board.} 9. O-O
O-O 10. Qc2 {This is the main move here.} Bb7 11. a3 {And this, too, is the
main move. You can also play 11.e4 e5 12.h3 or 11.h3 immediately or other
moves.} Rc8 {And now I was happy to play this, because I had this big idea. 11.
..Rc8 in itself should not be a shocker, because Kasimdzhanov already used it
against Topalov in the Grand Prix in London. In that game followed 12.b4 c5 13.
bxc5 Bxf3 14.gxf3 Nxc5 15.dxc5 Rxc5 16.f4 Nd5 17.Bb2 Nxc3 18.Bxc3 Qc7 19.Rfc1

26.Rd1 Rc7 27.Rd7 Rxd7 28.Bxd7 Kg7 29.e4 Kf6 30.Kf3 a5 31.e5+ Ke7 32.Ba4 Bc5
33.h3 Bb6 34.Bb5 Bc5 35.Ba4 Bb6 36.Bb5 Bc5 37.Ba4 Draw.} 12. Ng5 {At first
sight this seems more logical. If instead of 11...Rc8 I had played 11...a6,
then 12.Ng5 is an important line there. And if I'd continue 12...Bxh2+ then
I'd rather have the pawn on a6 then the rook on c8. But the advantage of 11...
Rc8 is that now I can play:} c5 $1 {The point of 11...Rc8, and easy to miss.
Black ignores White's move.} 13. Nxh7 ({After} 13. Bxh7+ Kh8 14. Be4 Nxe4 15.
Ngxe4 Bb8 {Black has good compensation. Either I take on d4 and you have an
isolated pawn there, or he takes on c5 and you have two bishops staring at his
kingside, plus a rook ready to swing over to the kingside. That's a helluva
lot for a pawn. Plus you have drawing mechanisms such as} 16. Nxc5 Bxh2+ 17.
Kxh2 Qh4+ 18. Kg1 Bxg2) ({After} 13. dxc5 {Black takes with the rook,} Rxc5 {
, and once he frees himself his play is quite easy.}) ({Finally, in case of} 
13. Nxb5 {now} Bxh2+ {works:} 14. Kxh2 Ng4+ 15. Kg1 Qxg5 {as White's kingside
is much more exposed, because my white-squared bishop is not staring at a pawn
on c6, but it's actually staring at g2, and after} 16. f3 {Black plays} cxd4 {
with a clear advantage.}) 13... Ng4 {This, too, was more or less prep.} 14. f4
({After} 14. h3 {I remembered} Bh2+ $1 ({on} 14... Qh4 15. f4 {is strong}) 15.
Kh1 Qh4 {with good compensation for Black both after} 16. Be4 ({and} 16. d5
Rfd8) 16... Bxe4 17. Qxe4 f5 18. Qxe6+ Kxh7 19. Qxd7 cxd4 20. exd4 Bb8 21. Kg1
Bh2+ 22. Kh1 {and the bishop goes back to b8 and you repeat. However, after 14.
f4 I couldn't remember all the details.}) 14... cxd4 15. exd4 {Here I spent
about half an hour trying to remember what exactly Black was supposed to. But
of course it's a big help if you know that basically Black is OK. That bit is
clear, you just have to figure out how. And I remembered a line where I got a
knight to d3 and from this I fgured out that the right move had to be 15...
Bc5! So it was my prep, but I worked it out at the board again.} ({For
completeness' sake, taking the exchange with} 15. Nxf8 {would give Black
excellent compensation after} Bxf8 16. h3 dxc3 17. hxg4 Nf6 {.}) 15... Bc5 $1 (
{As you may have noticed, after} 15... Qh4 {White could have transposed to the
first comment between brackets after White's 14th move (the one in case Black
doesn't interpolate 14...Bh2+!).} 16. h3) 16. Be2 {This is actually a mistake.
But at the board everything looks scary and in contrast to me he didn't know
that White's position was good.} ({After} 16. dxc5 Nxc5 17. Nxf8 Nxd3 {I get
my knight to d3, but he manages to free his pieces:} 18. h3 Qd4+ 19. Kh1 Ndf2+
20. Rxf2 Nxf2+ 21. Kh2 Kxf8 22. Qh7 Nd3 23. Qh8+ Ke7 24. Qh4+ f6 25. Qg3 Kf7
26. Be3 {and this should end in a draw.}) 16... Nde5 $3 {Found after a little
but of effort. It's obviously important to start in this order.} ({As} 16...
Bxd4+ 17. Kh1 Nxh2 (17... Nde5 18. fxe5) {runs into} 18. Ng5 $1 {. And, to be
honest, once you see the right ideas, the rest of the game plays itself.}) 17.
Bxg4 ({The knight cannot be taken,} 17. fxe5 {, because of} Qxd4+ 18. Kh1 Qg1+
19. Rxg1 Nf2# {mate.}) 17... Bxd4+ 18. Kh1 Nxg4 {Here I had to see that
against both his 19th moves, 19...f5 wins.} 19. Nxf8 ({After} 19. Ng5 f5 {the
win is a bit slower, but White is still helpless after} 20. h3 Rf6 21. Nf3 Rh6
{.}) 19... f5 $1 ({Here it's important too. I should avoid} 19... Qh4 {because
of} 20. Qh7+ {and White saves himself.}) 20. Ng6 Qf6 21. h3 ({There is not
much left to say. If he plays} 21. Ne5 {then} Nxh2 {wins.}) 21... Qxg6 22. Qe2
Qh5 {Attacking the h3-pawn.} 23. Qd3 $2 {I guess he got a bit tired at the end.
} ({He could have prolonged the agony with} 23. Rf3 {but I don't think it
would have changed the result:} Nf2+ 24. Kh2 ({or} 24. Rxf2 Qxh3+ 25. Kg1 Qxg2#
{mate}) 24... Bxf3 25. Qxf3 Qxf3 26. gxf3 Bxc3 (26... Nd3 $19) 27. bxc3 Rxc3 {
and Black wins.}) 23... Be3 {And after this move he had to resign immediately.
At the press conference I brought up the comparison with Rotlevi-Rubinstein.
As soon as I saw the position that was the game that came to mind. But I am
sure Gelfand would have recognized it immediately as well, because he is a big
Rubinstein fan also. I saw some very flattering reactions to our game,
evergreen was one of them, and it would be silly to pretend that I didn't find
this game incredibly beautiful, especially to play. I am quite proud of it.} *
