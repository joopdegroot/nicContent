{Normally, when writing an introduction to a game that I won, I would write
something about my tournament situation and the reason why I was particularly
ambitious for this game. This time I simply had too many reasons to be
ambitious, so a fight it would definitely be.} 1. d4 {When I played Fabiano in
Wijk aan Zee last year, it was hard for me. I didn't know what to expect, as I
share most of my repertoire with him (and a disastrous loss it was!). Now
things were even worse and even more of our cards were known to the other 
(both Caruana and Giri are being trained by Vladimir Chuchelov - ed.).
Nevertheless, I decided to just prepare as I would do with any other player.}
d5 2. c4 e6 {When thinking about what Fabiano would do in an attempt not to
play our main openings, the Grunfeld and the Slav, by applying the method of
elimination, I realized that ...Bb4+ somewhere was the only way for him. But I
forgot one other line.} 3. Nf3 c6 {The Noteboom Slav, always a surprise. Now
it became a little bit of a guessing game: Who knows what? Where to go? And
where to deviate?} 4. Nc3 {I decided to stay principled and ask him if he is
really ready to bluff me all the way.} dxc4 $1 {And he was!} 5. a4 Bb4 6. g3 $5
{Finally I decided to transpose into my favourite type of position with a
bishop on g2, leading to some sort of a Catalan. Believe me, I have played the
move g2-g3 when it was far more inappropriate than in this position.} (6. e3 {
leads to highly complex positions that I am slightly familiar with after} b5 7.
Bd2 a5 8. axb5 Bxc3 9. Bxc3 cxb5 10. b3 Bb7 11. bxc4 b4 {, but I saw no need
to take the game out of my comfort zone.}) 6... Nf6 {I think this is a wrong
choice. With this particular move-order, Black had another very tempting
option.} ({After} 6... c5 $5 {basically my only reference was a game Del
Rio-Perez Candelario, played at a board close to me in the recent Spanish
League. The good thing about those competitions is that you get to know many
other players, with their own ideas and views on chess. That game continued:}
7. Bg2 Nc6 8. Be3 Nge7 $1 {An aesthetically very pleasing move. Now Del Rio
went} 9. O-O $6 {and his opponent took on d4. When I asked him what was wrong
with9...Nf5, he nodded and said: 'Yes, ...Nf5 is better!'. But when thinking
about my move 6.g3 I realized that instead of 9.0-0, White can take on c5. I
quickly scanned the possibilities and came to the conclusion that I shouldn't
be much worse. That, combined with the bishop on g2- enough reasons to go for
it!} ({After} 9. dxc5 {things are not that easy for Black. For example in the
game Harikrishna-Nyback, he got under pressure after} Nd5 10. Bd2 Nxc3 11. Bxc3
Bxc3+ 12. bxc3 Qa5 13. O-O Qxc5 14. Rb1 a6 15. Nd2 O-O 16. Ne4 Qe7 17. Qd6 $1))
7. Bg2 {Now I was happy.} Nbd7 8. O-O O-O 9. Qc2 {I had no idea about this
position, but I felt very comfortable. This natural move I made pretty fast.
My plan includes building up the pressure with Rd1 and also perhaps thinking
of recapturing the lonely soldier on c4 with moves like Na2 or Nd2.} ({The
direct} 9. Nd2 {felt premature and indeed after} e5 $1 10. Nxc4 exd4 11. Qxd4
Nc5 $1 {Black is just better.} (11... Nb6 {was what I had seen and is also
good enough.})) 9... Qa5 $5 {I don't know where Fabiano excavated this move.
After the game he told me he thought it was theory. In fact, it was nearly
never played, but it isn't bad at all. Maybe my opponent had once looked at
this line, maybe even from some other move order.} ({Instead of the text-move,
} 9... Qe7 {looks logical, to play for ...e5. It seems premature though in
view of} 10. Bf4 $1 {, preventing ...e5, and after} a5 (10... Nd5 11. Bd2 {and
e4 is coming}) 11. e4 {, the queen on e7 is clearly misplaced.}) ({However,} 
9... a5 $5 {seems the most flexible. Now, once I lose my coordination slightly
and go for the c4 pawn, Black will get in his ...e5:} 10. Rd1 ({after} 10. e4
$5 {the game can continue with the standard sequence} e5 $5 (10... h6 {of
course is also possible.}) 11. dxe5 Ng4 12. e6 $1 fxe6 {with standard
compensation, but somehow this particular version looks fine for Black.}) 10...
Qe7 11. Na2 (11. Bf4 $5 {is possible here, too, but Black is happy with the
inclusion of Rd1 and ...a5:} Nd5 12. Bd2) 11... Bd6 12. Qxc4 e5 13. Qc2 {with
a balanced position. Both sides have their plusses.}) 10. Na2 {I must say I
was a bit too optimisti. If Fabiano had found the correct plan things would
not have been that clear. It was also possible to build up the pressure.} ({
After} 10. Bg5 $5 {the queen turns out to be misplaced on a5:} h6 11. Bxf6 Nxf6
12. Ne5 $1) (10. Rd1 $5 {was also an option, and also clever:} e5 11. Na2 $1
Be7 12. Bd2 $1 {and the queen can't get across the 5th rank to h5:} Qc7 13.
Qxc4 {.}) 10... Bd6 $2 {The bishop is really awkward here. It reminds me of my
game with Erwin l'Ami where ...Bd6 was looking more natural at first sight,
but in fact Be7 was far more clever.} ({After} 10... Be7 {the same sequence
doesn't work, while the ...e5 push still has enough supporters:} 11. Qxc4 $5 (
11. Bd2 {was my initial idea, but after} Qh5 {Black will follow up with ...e5
and have easy play.}) 11... Nb6 12. Qc2 Qxa4 13. b3 Qa5 {. The queen can
return to its shelter. Still White has compensation for the pawn after} 14. e4
Nbd7 {and say} 15. Rd1 {.}) 11. Qxc4 $1 Nb6 $2 {Going for a losing sequence.
This was the last chance for Black to go for the correct plan.} ({After} 11...
e5 $1 {things aren't too bad, even though I have a good version here with the
queen on a5 making little sense.}) 12. Qc2 Qxa4 {Let's not abuse the question
marks, as once you say A, you also say B.} (12... Qf5 {leads nowhere:} 13. Qb3
Qd5 14. Qd1 $1 {and Nc3 comes with tempo, and then it all unfolds nicely.}) 13.
b3 Qa5 14. Ne5 $2 {I was so happy with this move that I didn't even realize
that I could have won the game outright. The fact that  could win on move 14
shows that perhaps something went wrong with Black's opening, but then again I
couldn't imagine it was that bad already, especially since Fabiano took a lot
of time on his last few moves. Still, Bd2 is a threat here and Black is in
deep trouble.} ({After} 14. e4 $1 Be7 {I have} 15. Ng5 $1 {and I threaten to
trap the queen and to play e5 at the same time!}) 14... Nbd7 {Almost the only
move that does not lose material.} 15. Nc4 Qc7 16. Nxd6 {The most ruthless.}
Qxd6 17. Rd1 {Now I have incredible compensation, something a Catalan player
never manages to get. Fabiano tries the only way to free himself:} e5 {But
even that fails:} 18. Nc3 $1 {If not for this resource, Black would have had
reasonable chances to survive. He is about to solve the problem of his light
squared bishop problem, but fortunately I realized in time to realize that the
exchange sac that I initially thought I should avoid is actually something I
should look forward to.} ({Obviously,} 18. Bb2 {gives strong compensation, but
after say} exd4 19. Bxd4 Qe7 20. Nc3 a6 21. e4 Rd8 {, intending ...Nf8, Black
is still in the game. Although even here, he is probably in deep trouble after}
22. Na4 $1) 18... exd4 19. Ba3 c5 $2 {The position was already bad, but Black
had to go for the exchange sac anyway with} (19... Qe5 $1 20. Bxf8 Nxf8 {.
This was what I feared at first when I sat thinking about 18.Nc3. But then I
noticed that I can actually centralize my knight very nicely:} 21. Ne4 $1 Nd5
$1 {With this one Black is still fighting, but obviously his position is
pretty sad anyway:} (21... Bg4 22. Qc5 $1 {was more or less the line I saw}) (
21... Ne6 {is just losing in the long run:} 22. Nxf6+ Qxf6 23. b4) {for example
} 22. Qd3 Ne6 23. f4 {when Black can try to sacrifice the whole rook with ...
Nxf4, but it shouldn't be enough.}) 20. e3 $1 ({Here} 20. Na4 {was tempting
but after} Re8 21. Nxc5 Qc7 {Black is at least able to complete his
development, although here, too, of course, he will have a terrible endgame
ahead.}) 20... d3 {Cute, but it doesn't save Black.} 21. Rxd3 Qb8 {This was
the last idea of my opponent. Now he is intending ...b6, inviting me to give
up the long diagonal. However, now my pieces suddenly switch to the kingside.}
22. Nd5 $1 Nxd5 23. Rxd5 {I had seen my next move coming and was very proud of
my concept.} b6 24. Bb2 $1 {And suddenly it becomes clear that Black's
position is hopeless. I have all the diagonals and soon I will have all the
files too.} a5 {Now I was thinking what would be the most spectacular way to
win, in order to secure the daily 'public prize' (worth 300 euro - ed.).
However, not having won a single game in the previous 10 rounds, I got angry
at myself for having such luxurious thoughts and decided to be safe and enter
my final piece into the attack (fortunately I won the prize anyway).} 25. Ra4
$5 {I thought that with two killing bishops, a queen and now two killing rooks,
nothing could go wrong.} ({Instead of my move there was} 25. Rh5 g6 26. Qf5 $3
{Sniff-sniff.}) 25... Re8 26. Rg5 g6 27. Bd5 Kf8 28. Rf4 {And as things
started to look a little too humiliating my opponent congratulated me.} 1-0
