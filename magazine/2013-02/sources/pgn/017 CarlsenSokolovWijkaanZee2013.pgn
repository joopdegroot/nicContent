1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O b5 6. Bb3 Bb7 7. d3 Bc5 8. a4
O-O 9. Bg5 {The complications that arise after} (9. Nc3 Na5 {have been working
well for Black, as far as I know. The text is a more positional approach,
aiming for a slight advantage.}) 9... h6 10. Bh4 d6 11. c3 Qe7 {Ivan went for
this after a bit of thought. I assumed the plan was to go ...Nd8-e6 at some
point, while staying flexible and keeping the option of going ...g5 at the
appropriate juncture.} 12. Na3 {This is just awful, especially in combination
with my next move} (12. Nbd2 {would have been the sane choice.}) (12. Kh1 {was
played in one of the three games that reached this position. It probably makes
more sense than what I did.}) 12... Na5 {Of course.} 13. Bc2 ({I had assumed
that} 13. axb5 Nxb3 14. Qxb3 {would work out for me, but Black actually has
several good options here, including the simple} Rfb8 15. Qc2 (15. bxa6 Bxe4
16. Qd1 Bxf3 17. Qxf3 g5 18. b4 Bb6 {and ...Rxa6}) 15... Bxa3 16. Rxa3 axb5 {
and Black is absolutely fine.}) (13. Ba2 {was another option, but after the
simple} Bxa3 14. bxa3 c5 {it appeared to me that Black would have too easy a
game, with ...c4 coming up, so I decided to keep the tension at the cost of
two tempi.}) 13... b4 14. Nb1 g5 15. Bg3 Nh5 {Obviously, Black is doing well
now. However, the white position still has some long-term potential,
especially based on the potentially offside knight on a5 (spoiler alert: it
did not make another move in the game).} 16. Nbd2 Ba7 17. Re1 bxc3 18. bxc3
Nxg3 19. hxg3 Qf6 20. Qe2 Rfb8 21. Rab1 Bc8 22. Nf1 {It seems that White is
not really worse here, but it was only after the next move that I really
started to hope for something more.} Rxb1 {In slight time-pressure, Ivan
decided to simplify. However, the double rook exchange loses crucial time,
allowing me to get in Ne3 and d4.} (22... Be6 {or most other sensible moves
would have been absolutely fine.}) 23. Rxb1 Rb8 24. Rxb8 Bxb8 25. Ne3 Ba7 (
25... Nc6 26. Nh2 {with Ng4 to come would also have been unpleasant.}) 26. d4 {
This is the point. I have time to develop an initative before he can bring the
knight and bishop back into play.} g4 {This just allows the second knight to
jump in.} (26... exd4 27. cxd4 Bxd4 28. Nd5 {is no good either, but}) (26... c6
{would still have been reasonably solid.}) 27. Nd5 Qd8 28. Nh4 c6 (28... exd4
29. Nf5 {spells disaster for Black.}) 29. Ne3 h5 (29... exd4 30. Nhf5 {is
similar to the previous note.}) 30. Nhf5 Qf6 31. Qd3 Bb6 32. Bb1 Kf8 33. Ba2
Bc7 {I've achieved everything I wanted, but it's still not easy to break
through, as attempts to play on the kingside with f3 or f4 did not appear
convincing at all. I decided that I probably needed to attack a6 somehow,
possibly after including d5, ...c5.} 34. Qb1 Ke8 35. Qb4 {Now the bishop is
going to d3, and the queen to e2 or f1.} d5 {A tempting move, especially in
time-trouble, but now the centralised white pieces will rule. However, passive
defence was also unpromising, for instance} (35... Kf8 36. Bb1 Ke8 37. Bd3 Kf8
38. Qb1 Kg8 39. d5 c5 40. Qf1 Bd7 41. Bxa6 Bxa4 42. Bb5 Bb3 43. f3 gxf3 44.
gxf3 {and the black kingside is helpless, with all the minor pieces stranded
on the queenside.}) 36. Bb1 exd4 37. cxd4 dxe4 38. Bxe4 Be6 {This loses, but
it is hard to suggest anything better.} 39. Qc5 Kd7 40. d5 cxd5 41. Nxd5 Bxd5
42. Qxd5+ Kc8 43. Ne3 {Material is still equal, but the difference in activity
and king safety is simply too huge.} Qa1+ 44. Kh2 Qxa4 (44... h4 {was the one
move I needed to calculate, but it is not too hard to see that after} 45. Qa8+
Kd7 46. Bf5+ Ke7 47. Nd5+ Kd6 48. Nxc7 hxg3+ 49. fxg3 Kxc7 50. Qc8+ Kb6 51.
Qd8+ Ka7 52. Qxa5 Qh8+ 53. Kg1 Qd4+ 54. Kf1 {White easily escapes the checks
and wins.}) 45. Qa8+ Kd7 46. Nd5 {This one is just lazy. I played it fairly
quickly, assuming that 46...Bd8, which he did in fact play, was the only move.}
({I should have gone} 46. Bf5+ Ke7 47. Qa7 Qc6 48. Qd4 {. Centralisation! The
threat of Nd5 is lethal.}) 46... Bd8 ({Now} 46... Qc6 {would have allowed
Black to fight on for a while, as there is no clear-cut win:} 47. Qh8 Qe6 48.
Qxh5 Kd6) ({And} 46... Qd4 47. Qf8 Qe5 48. Qxf7+ Kc6 49. Nf6+ Kb5 50. Bd3+ Kc6
51. Nxh5 {would also have prolonged the resistance.}) 47. Bf5+ Ke8 48. Qc8 {
This one he evidently missed. There is no defence to Bd7+ followed by Nf6+, so
he resigned.} 1-0
